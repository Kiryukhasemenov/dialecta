#Automatic annotation

To perform automatic noramlization and morphological annotation of the whole elan file go to a recording's moderation page and click the `Perform automatic annotation` button:

This would take a while (about a minute, depending on the recording's length) so please be patient)

When automatic annotation is finally done, the standart transcription view will open. You can make manual changes as usual in the workbench to the right. When you are satisfied with the result, click save button in the upper right corner to save changes to the elan-file.
Note that elan-files are not saved automatically after this operation! (This mean that if you don't like the result of automatic annotation for some reason, you can just go back to the menu and these changes would not be saved)

After auto-annotation is performed, the `Automatically annotated` status of recording would change to `True` (green tick)
